## Stack
I started this project in 2009 and it's codebase has changed mainly for easier user authentication using other libraries.
- PHP/MySQL
- [php-login](https://github.com/panique/php-login/) framework (outdated)

## Re-write Goals
- learn a more modern approach to this type of project/web app
- move from PHP to JavaScript
- move away from MySQL to something faster/lighter
- off-line mode to store food/mood data when unconnected
- deploy script process
